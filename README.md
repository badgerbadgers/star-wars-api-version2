# star-wars-api-version2 uses a new url(https://www.swapi.tech/) because at the time of submission original url(https://www.swapi.dev) was down.

Directions: The page will load with API data of a random star wars character. There will be some properties displayed on the page, and a button to generate a new character. One of the properties 'Homeworld' will have the name of a planet, it should be underlined and the text should be red. Hovering over the text your mouse will change to a pointer indicating that you can click the link. Clicking the red text should now show that planet you clicked on with new properties displayed on screen. In addition to that there should two buttons on the page. One to generate a new character and one to go back to the previous character.
